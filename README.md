## Theory

A formal language can be described using grammars and automata. A regular grammar is a type of grammar in which production rules follow a restricted form that allows the language to be recognized by a finite automaton. In this laboratory work, a right-linear grammar is analyzed. Right-linear grammars generate regular languages, which means they can be represented by finite automata.

There exists a fundamental equivalence between these two models. Every right-linear grammar can be transformed into a finite automaton, and every finite automaton recognizes a regular language. This project demonstrates that equivalence both theoretically and through a working implementation.

## Objectives

The objective of this work is to represent a regular grammar programmatically, to generate valid strings using the grammar, to convert the grammar into an equivalent finite automaton, and to verify whether given strings belong to the language using the automaton. Another important goal is to demonstrate the equivalence between grammars and automata in practice.

## Implementation Description

A class was created to represent the grammar by storing its nonterminals, terminals, start symbol, and production rules corresponding to Variant 26. The program generates valid strings by starting from the start symbol and repeatedly applying production rules until only terminal symbols remain. Because the grammar contains cycles, a maximum number of steps is used to prevent infinite derivations.

Since the grammar is right-linear, it can be converted directly into a finite automaton. Each nonterminal becomes a state, while productions that end with a terminal lead to a newly introduced final state. Another class implements the finite automaton and simulates its operation by processing input strings symbol by symbol and updating the current states according to the transition function. If a final state is reached after processing the entire string, the string is accepted as part of the language.

The main program constructs the grammar, converts it into the finite automaton, generates example strings, and tests multiple inputs for membership in the language.

## Conclusions

The implementation successfully generates valid strings from the grammar and verifies them using the finite automaton. All generated valid strings begin with the symbol d because of the production rule S → dA, and valid strings terminate with either b or d due to terminal productions. The presence of cycles in the grammar allows the creation of strings of arbitrary length. Strings that do not follow these rules are correctly rejected by the automaton.

The results confirm that the constructed automaton recognizes exactly the same language that is generated by the grammar. Therefore, the laboratory work demonstrates the theoretical principle that right-linear grammars and finite automata describe the same class of languages, namely regular languages.
